# Problem #2

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i`
of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except
the one at `i`.

For example, if our input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output would be
`[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. If our input was `[3, 2, 1]`, the expected output would be
`[2, 3, 6]`.

**Follow-up:** what if you can't use division?
