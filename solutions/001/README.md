# Problem #1

Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Solution

This solution is named **Ksum** which refers to the question if two numbers add up to k.
